Can't have a website without talking about how it's made.

woord.baudvine.net is part of a larger effort to simplify my online
infrastructure situation:

- Disentangle baudvine.net from Google Workspaces.
- Move stuff under a single domain.
- Let go of the excellent dvanb.nl domain, which is more attached to my first
  name than I am.
- Drop the VPS I'm not really using for anything but a static site no one reads.

*Woord* is hosted at [nearlyfreespeech.net](https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/),
one of the most stick-with-what-you-know services I've had the pleasure of
using. NFSN provides hosting without a subscription fee, making you pay only for
the resources you use - which works out beautifully for the "static site with
five readers" scenario.

The site is cobbled together by [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/), a static
site generator that takes Markdown and ReStructuredText documents as input. I
don't have to worry about the security woes of a dynamic site, and I get to type
my stuff in the same markup language I'm already familiar with.
