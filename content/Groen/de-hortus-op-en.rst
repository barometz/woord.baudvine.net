    A tree - I don't remember the name - in the Hortus in Amsterdam.

In October of last year I visited the `Hortus Botanicus
<https://www.dehortus.nl/en/>`_ in Amsterdam. This was an almost religious
experience, so naturally it took me a year to visit another garden like it. This
past weekend it was time for the `Oude Hortus <https://umu.nl/oude-hortus/>`_ in
Utrecht. Another delightful experience - I'm well behind on using my vacation
time, and it feels like I'm good to go for another half year. I've made up my
mind: I'm going the hortus up.

That's a poorly translated pun; rest assured it's funny in the original Dutch.

In the Netherlands, 27 botanical gardens are members of the `Dutch Association
of Botanical Gardens <https://www.botanischetuinen.nl/en>`_, the NVBT. Several
more gardens of all sizes exist that aren't a member for one reason or another.
This includes public arboretums, centuries-old university gardens, but also an
ecological garden that's open for one afternoon every week during the growing
season. I don't plan on making a comprehensive list, but a brief search turns up
about 40 gardens.

In the coming years I want to visit a bunch of them. This is *hopefully* the
least interesting post in the series I want to write about that. It's a good
excuse for me to write more - I enjoy writing, but rarely have anything
interesting to say - and I'll visit the gardens either way. Stay tuined!
