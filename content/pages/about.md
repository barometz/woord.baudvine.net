I am [the barometz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable_Lamb_of_Tartary), a
programmer, plant haver, music maker, and general tinkerer. In my day job I work
on embedded-adjacent stuff to automate electronics production. In my spare time,
I have a thousand ADHD-induced hobbies (knitting, plants, ukulele, clarinet,
model building, ...), none of which I'm very good at.

You can e-mail me at [woord at baudvine.net](mailto:woord at baudvine.net).
